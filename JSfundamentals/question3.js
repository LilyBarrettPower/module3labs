// Which of the following console. log message will print? why? 
if (0) console.log('#1 zero is true')
if ("0") console.log('#2 zero is true')
if (null) console.log('null is true')
if (-1) console.log('negative is true')
if (1) console.log('positive is true')
// if specifies a block of code if a condition is true 
// Non empty strings are evaluated as true 
// numbers that are not zero are evaluated as true
// 0 and null are evaluated as false 

// Therefore, lines 1 and 3 will not print and the other lines will print
